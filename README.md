# Flash Automation Script (JSFL) - Add Sounds From Library To Timeline

This JSFL Script automatically adds the sounds from the Flash library to the timeline on layer "Sounds", it can also add labels for each sound on another layer. It extends the timeline according to the sound durations and adds a configurable gap between sounds.

**You must specify the constant bitrate of your sounds in the dialog box when launching** (needed by the script for duration calculation of each sound)
